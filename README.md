#Takeaway (Rubyist Challenge) 
=================

This was the test set at the end of our fourth week at Makers Academy. The aim of the test was to build a takeaway system. Building on this we then had to attempt to use to the Twilio API in order to send sms messages. RSpec was used throughout for test coverage and the task was set by Enrique Comba Riepenhausen @ecomba.

#Takeaway (Rubyist Challenge) 
=================

This was the test set at the end of our fourth week at Makers Academy. The aim of the test was to build a takeaway system. Building on this we then had to attempt to use to the Twilio API in order to send sms messages. RSpec was used throughout for test coverage and the task was set by Enrique Comba Riepenhausen @ecomba.

#Airports (Arcitect Challenge) 
=================

This was the test set at the end of our third week at Makers Academy and it followed on from the Boris Bikes project which we did during the week that introuduced us to OOP and OOD. We were told to imagine that we were writing software to control the flow of planes at an airport. We also had to consider the weather, this would normally be sunny but at times stormy and at these times no plane could take off and land. Every plane had to have a status as to whether it was flying or landing. This was my first attempt at the challenge.
